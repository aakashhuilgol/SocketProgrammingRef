Simulate Client Server Environment using socket programming for the following:

Implement two different variations of file transfer server. One is Bandwidth division multiple access file transfer and other is Time division multiple access file 
transfer server and compare the time required to transfer data using the two resource sharing policies.

Hint : Implement one server and one client over stream socket API. The server is simply a file transfer server that forwards a file when a client requests for the same.
However the policies varies depending on how it handles requests from multiple clients.

Hint 2: Whenever the BDMAFT server recieves requests from multiple clients, it handles the request in parallel. That is, for every client request, it simply forks a 
child process and the child process handles the file transfer. Therefore if there are 3 child processes running in parallel, then the total bandwidth is subdivided 
among those 3 child processes.

Hint 3: For TDMAFT multiple client file download requests are handled in a sequential round robin fashion. Whenever a new request comes from a client, the request
is kept in a write queue. Assume that there are 3 such requests in the write queue. Then the requests are processed using a sequential round robin fashion with a 
predetermined time slice. This can be implemented using a select() system call.
